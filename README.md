# 📬 Anonymous Letter

**Anonymous Letter** is a minimalist web app built with **React.js + Vite** and also powered by **Firebase Firestore**, where users can send anonymous letters to anyone. No accounts, no names, just words.

You can leave heartfelt messages, secret compliments, or even a surprise note to brighten someone’s day, and they’ll never know it was you.  
Want to know if someone left a message for you? Just search your name and see!
(inspired by the we "The Unsent Project")
